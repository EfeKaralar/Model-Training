# Model Training for Advanced Vehicle Team

## Introduction
This is a model training code implemented by me to be utilized by the Advanced Vehicle Team (AVT) club in the Pennsylvania State University. This repository is modified significantly from the one used in the AVT in order not to put the team's code in danger. Besides being heavily modified, the repository also constitues a very small part of the code used in AVT and thus is not a danger to the private repository of the team.

## What does it do?
The goal of the repository is to train a custom YOLO (You Only Look Once) machine learning (ML) alogrithm on a custom dataset. Then it tests the ML algorithm on a video file.
